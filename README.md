# Hello world!

I'm Hank McGill (he/him).  I've been learning JavaScript, React, Webpack, HTML, and CSS for about a year now.  I'm a self-taught student currently finishing up [The Odin Project](https://github.com/theodinproject) advanced JavaScript course.  Welcome to my GitHub profile!

Right now I'm building my personal website and debugging some projects you can see on my profile - next up, I'm planning to learn Node.js and start getting my hands dirty with some more backend experience!

After growing up in Paris, I moved to Los Angeles to attend Loyola Marymount University (majoring in English) and played in indie rock bands for almost ten years.  I got to tour the world and perform with some of my favorite artists.  Now I'm more interested in learning JavaScript, but you can check out my music by looking up [Hank Fontaine](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6BMHQ7tEQSZNqlFZPG7AbT) wherever you stream music!

## Collaboration

I would love to collaborate on any and all web apps you might be working on.  I'm particularly interested in improving my React skills - and I'm definitely looking to expand my API experience as well!  Message me with any ideas you might have!
